    <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Solamp Inc, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</strong></p>

    <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.</p>

    <p>The Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Services.</p>

    <p>We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Solamp is a brand operated by Solamp Inc. that offers and sells to the public solar electric, battery energy storage and related cleantech renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle products, as well as services and education about the material and industry. Services, such as the "Premium Support Package", "Technical Consulting Services" and "Online Courses" are offered. Both product and services are bound by these terms and conditions.</p>

    <p>We are here to help you with your renewable energy system installation. We don't have the same level of knowledge about your site as you, and/or the system installer do. If you don't feel comfortable with any or all of the system design and installation process please seek the help of a professional. We will be happy to work with the professionals you've contracted with, or directly with you, the DIY solar and storage installer.</p>

    <p>The ultimate responsibility for the systems, including but not limited to product compatibility, permitting, interconnection, operability, and performance is with the purchaser of products and/or services.</p>

    <h3>2. Scope of Work</h3>
    <p>We want to offer the best experience ever when it comes to solar and energy storage design, installation and maintenance, but here are a few things to note about the limitations of our offering. The limits include but are not limited to:</p>

    <h4>Onsite Work</h4>
    <p>We do not offer any onsite work. We don't visit site locations or offer hands-on service at the project location. We need you to provide good data and information about the site conditions and we will do our best to advise based on all the information you provide. Not all problems can be fixed remotely. Your individual construction project may run into unforeseen or unexpected challenges that will require onsite diagnosis to correct. Our services are never a replacement for onsite services that are needed.</p>
    <p><em>The purchaser acknowledges that The Company does not provide any onsite work and that onsite services are most likely required for completion of the project.</em></p>

    <h4>Product Estimates, Performance Claims and Product Recommendations</h4>
    <p>System estimates are estimates only and not guarantees. We try our best to be as accurate as possible in our estimates but we are not onsite and many factors can lead to more or less production than expected. We make a good faith effort to provide information that is technically accurate but are unable to guarantee that the information provided is entirely accurate and it is the ultimate responsibility of the buyer to confirm information provided by The Company is correct.</p>
    <p><em>The signer of this document acknowledges that The Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions and system production is not guaranteed.</em></p>

    <h4>Shipping and Delivery</h4>
    <p>Once your product arrives you'll need to sign for delivery. Most systems are shipped by Less Than Truckload (LTL) freight. You must make sure to let us know if you need a lift gate, residential delivery or if a call ahead is required. If we don't know ahead of time extra shipping fees may apply. Before signing, inspect your order for damage. Not all damage is visible on the packing slip. If you suspect damage, write "concealed damage possible" on the packing slip, or unbox your package for inspection before signing. Once you sign, you are accepting that the product was delivered in perfect condition, unless noted. Please don't refuse delivery. If you see damage, note it on the packing slip and take pictures of the whole shipment.</p>

    <h4>Programs, Incentives, Grants and Project Economics</h4>
    <p>We do not offer tax advice. Everyone has different tax situations and we are not tax experts. Any claims about tax credits or other tax consequences in regards to a system is for general education purposes and not specific advice. Get the opinion of a certified professional accountant or tax professional before making any decisions.</p>
    <p>We do not offer investment advice. We may show you expected savings or returns associated with installation of your system, or claims about potential increase in property value. You must complete independent due diligence of these claims and make your own decisions regardless of the information provided by The Company. Get the opinion of a professional investment advisor if you are making purchasing decisions based on economic factors, such as savings, returns, tax credit, or government rebates.</p>
    <p>Government rebates, credits and programs are not guaranteed, including utility net metering rates. We are not responsible for securing any grant, rebate, or credit offered by the utility or government. We will offer guidance on these programs to the best of our ability. The cost of energy is inherently unpredictable and we are not providing an energy price forecast.</p>
    <p><em>The buyer acknowledges that The Company is not responsible for securing any government grant or additional incentive of any kind and that The Company is not providing financial or tax advice.</em></p>

    <h4>Warranties</h4>
    <p>The Company provides no warranty for products or services provided. In some cases the manufacturer of a product may provide a product warranty. The Company, at its discretion, may assist you in researching the specifics of any potential product warranty and the process in how to file a warranty claim with a manufacturer, if available.</p>
    <p>It is highly recommended that you review the manufacturer's warranty policy prior to making any purchases. We recommend keeping original packaging and receipts in case needed for the warranty claim process. The Company is not responsible for any warranty replacement, warranty enforcement or other warranty related claims.</p>
    <p><em>The buyer acknowledges that The Company does not offer a product warranty of any kind.</em></p>

    <h4>Permits</h4>
    <p>Your project may require local, state, federal or other permits. We are not responsible for securing any permits or licenses of any kind. We provide help and assistance for project development, including researching and advising on what permits may be required. We also will offer assistance in completing permit applications and answering questions that authorities having jurisdiction may have about your project. Our team has worked on projects around the world and across the United States, however each project has individual permitting requirements and it is impossible to have perfect knowledge of the requirements for each jurisdiction. We will put in a good faith effort to provide you with information regarding the permitting requirements for your project.</p>
    <p><em>The ultimate responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of permit applications, and with securing any and all required permits is with the buyer.</em></p>

    <h4>Interconnection</h4>
    <p>Your project may require a signed interconnection agreement with a utility company. We are not responsible for securing an interconnection agreement or completing an interconnection application. We may provide you with assistance in researching the local interconnection process and with support completing the application, at our discretion.</p>
    <p><em>The ultimate responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of interconnection applications, and with securing any and all required utility interconnection agreements is with the buyer.</em></p>

    <h4>Permission to Operate</h4>
    <p>Your project may require permission to operate from local authorities having jurisdiction, and/or the local utility company. Factors such as National Electric Code and product certifications (UL) may impact your ability to get permission to operate.</p>
    <p><em>The ultimate responsibility for securing Permission to Operate is with the buyer.</em></p>

    <h3>3. Our Services</h3>
    <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
    <p>The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services.

    <h3>22. Dispute Resolution</h3>

    <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
    <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Arbitration Association (AAA) website</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.</p>
    <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

    <h4>Small Claims Court Exception</h4>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring an individual action in small claims court in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, if the claim qualifies for small claims court jurisdiction.</p>

    <h4>Restrictions</h4>
    <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

    <h4>Exceptions to Arbitration</h4>
    <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</p>

    <h3>31. Responsibility</h3>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the products they purchase are compatible with each other and the specific location of installation. Neither Solamp nor any of its employees have visited the site or personally assessed the actual design requirements, and neither Solamp nor its employees are responsible for the components, compatibility, system design, installation, energy production, permits, code compliance and any other matter related to the system. Solamp is not the manufacturer of goods sold. Actual product may look different than pictured. Information provided on our websites, via email, over the phone and elsewhere are for informational purposes only and not a substitution for the customer's own due diligence, assessment and expertise. We recommend that customers not make buying decisions solely on the basis of information provided by the company. While we try our best to provide accurate information, Solamp makes no warranties or representations in terms of the accuracy of information provided.</p>

    <h3>32. Technical Representation and Support</h3>
    <p>Solamp does not guarantee any technical assistance or technical support. The Company may, at its discretion, from time to time, offer post-sales technical support and assistance. This potential service is not a replacement for the technical support offered by manufacturers, if any, and in no way makes Solamp responsible for system design, installation, product compatibility and adherence to any zoning, code or government regulation. Solamp wishes to help our customers make informed choices but we are not responsible for compatibility of items, product recommendations, technical support or sales advice. Please contact manufacturers directly for accurate answers to your technical questions both before and after point of sale.</p>

    <h3>33. Mutual Kindness and Respect</h3>
    <p>The Company and its employees are skilled professionals, trained to provide customers with kindness and respect at all times. Our expectation is that our customers will treat all of us at the Company likewise. Use of profanity, hostility, verbal abuse and general unpleasantness will constitute immediate grounds for termination of our business relationship. Continued attempts to contact The Company and/or its employees after termination of business relationship will be interpreted as harassment and dealt with as such.</p>

    <h3>34. Title and Risk of Loss</h3>
    <p>All orders ship Ex Works Origin and title and risk of loss passes from buyer to seller the moment that the item is given to the shipping carrier. The Company will provide reasonable assistance for lost or damaged items but the responsibility for damage and loss claims will be borne by the buyer. The Company may choose to assist the customer with a freight claim but this assistance in no way commits The Company to replace or refund the order. The buyer is advised to purchase appropriate insurance to protect against loss.</p>

    <h3>35. Cancellations and Change Orders</h3>
    <p>Many of the products and services sold by The Company are custom, built to order or are procured especially for the customer after placing an order. Additionally The Company relies heavily on automated processes for efficiency of business operations. For these reasons many of the products sold by The Company and orders confirmed cannot be canceled, delayed or returned for any reason. The Company may at its discretion allow for order cancellations, postponements, changes or returns, on a case by case basis. All sales are final.</p>

  <!-- SHIPPING POLICY -->
  <!-- ============================================== -->
  <section id="shipping-policy" class="section">
    <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 26, 2026</p>

    <h3>Shipping Delivery Times</h3>
    <p>We ship to US addresses only. For products leaving the United States, we can ship to the freight forwarder that you arrange. Payment via wire transfer or ACH may be required, at Solamp's discretion, if shipping to a freight forwarder or any address that doesn't match the billing address of the credit card being used for payment.</p>
    <p>We are also able to arrange for some international transactions via eBay. If you are outside the United States, see if an item is in our <a href="https://solampio.com/ebay/">eBay shop</a>, or <a href="https://solampio.com/contact-us/">contact us</a> to see if we can add it for you.</p>
    <p>Parcel packages ship via UPS or USPS. Oversized or overweight items ship via LTL Freight. Our shipping calculator in most cases will be able to provide quoted shipping prices. If for some reason we're not able to calculate shipping automatically you'll be prompted to submit a quote request. We'll get back to you the next business day with a quote that includes shipping.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or special requests please contact us before placing your order. You can call us by phone at <a href="tel:978-451-6890">(978) 451-6890</a>, or email us at <a href="mailto:info@solampio.com">info@solampio.com</a>, use the Request a Quote feature on our website, or use the <a href="https://solampio.com/contact-us/">contact us form</a> on our website.</p>

    <h3>Local Pickup</h3>
    <p>Some items are available for pickup at our location. When you are checking out, if an item is available for pickup, it will allow that as a shipping method. If you don't see pickup as a shipping option, it is likely because one or more items on your order are drop shipping from another location. We are able to consolidate products at our location for single shipment or pickup, but additional shipping and handling fees may apply. Please contact us for more information about this service.</p>
    <p>Local pickup orders do not include a pallet or packaging unless ordered prior to arrival. If additional packaging is requested we can wrap and strap your items to a pallet for an additional $200 handling fee. Please contact us to request this special service. Please be prepared with your own pallets, cardboard, plastic wrap, straps and other packaging methods upon arrival, or arrange for packaging service in advance of your pickup. We do our best to accommodate all walk-in customers, however during very busy times there may be a wait as we are preparing other orders for shipping deadlines, loading or unloading a truck delivery, or otherwise occupied. Order ahead online or by phone and we'll have your products waiting for you when you arrive.</p>
    <p>As a courtesy, we may bring your order to your vehicle. We cannot load your items into or onto your car, truck or other vehicle. We cannot help secure your product to your vehicle. Some of the products we sell are very heavy. If you are picking up make sure that you are able to lift the package, or have other people available to help you load.</p>

    <h3>Shipping Times</h3>
    <p>On average we ship items within 3 business days and very often we ship the same day of order. Some items are special order and have longer lead time. These lead times are noted on our website, however if you are in urgent need of a part, please contact us so we can confirm if expedited shipment is available.</p>
    <p>Most items take 1-5 business days for shipping transit. Most items ship from Massachusetts, however some items are drop shipped from another location. The amount of transit time an item will take depends on how close you are to the location where the item is shipping from. Contact us for urgent deliveries or specific delivery deadlines.</p>

    <h3>Risk of Loss</h3>
    <p>All orders ship Ex Works Origin and title and risk of loss passes from buyer to seller the moment that the item is given to the shipping carrier. The Company will provide reasonable assistance for lost or damaged items but the responsibility for damage and loss claims will be borne by the buyer.</p>

    <h3>Inspecting Your Delivery</h3>
    <p>Once your product arrives you may need to sign for delivery. You must make sure to let us know if you need a lift gate, residential delivery or if a call ahead is required. If we don't know ahead of time extra shipping fees may apply. Before signing, inspect your order for damage. Not all damage is visible on the packing slip. If you suspect damage, write "concealed damage possible" on the packing slip, or unbox your package for inspection before signing. Once you sign, you are accepting that the product was delivered in perfect condition, unless noted. Please don't refuse delivery. If you see damage, note it on the packing slip and take pictures of the whole shipment.</p>

    <p>If you would like to cancel your order prior to the order shipping, please contact us with that request and we will attempt to do so. Many items are custom made, built to order and/or special order and therefore may not be cancelable even if it has not yet shipped. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@solampio.com">info@solampio.com</a> or by phone at <a href="tel:978-451-6890">(978) 451-6890</a> to request an order cancellation.</p>

    <h3>Returns</h3>
    <p>We do not accept returns. Many products we sell, like lithium batteries, are hazardous materials and require specialized transportation to be shipped. Some products, like solar panels and solar racking, are oversized shipments that require specialized handling and packaging. Some items, like cables, wire and electrical boxes are made-to-order items. Some products are specifically procured for a customer's order on a case-by-case basis. For these reasons, and more, we are not able to accept returned items. <strong>All sales are final.</strong></p>

    <h3>Incorrect Items</h3>
    <p>If you believe you have received an incorrect item please contact us immediately, but not later than 15 days after delivery, at <a href="mailto:info@solampio.com">info@solampio.com</a> or by phone at <a href="tel:978-451-6890">(978) 451-6890</a>. You will be asked to submit evidence of the incorrect item, such as a photo or video, prior to any remedy being offered.</p>

    <h3>Shipping Damage</h3>
    <p>All items ship Ex Works Origin. We are not responsible for damage caused by the carrier. The buyer shall have sufficient insurance coverage for the value of the merchandise in transit or other means of remedy with the shipping company in the event of damage. In the event of damage to product in transit the buyer will be responsible for any damage claims made with the carrier.</p>
    <p>Upon delivery, buyer shall not sign the carrier's delivery receipt or other recipient acknowledgment of complete and undamaged delivery unless buyer first inspects the delivery to confirm that the correct number and type of products ordered has arrived, and that the products appear to be undamaged. We will not be able to replace damaged or missing items if the buyer fails to inspect the shipment upon delivery and later finds items missing or damaged. If shipment appears to be damaged or short items, do not refuse shipment, instead, accept the freight, note the damage on delivery paperwork, and take photos from all angles. Immediately contact us at <a href="mailto:info@solampio.com">info@solampio.com</a> or by phone at <a href="tel:978-451-6890">(978) 451-6890</a> and we will arrange for replacement of missing parts.</p>

    <h3>Defective Products</h3>
    <p>If a product is defective, the buyer should address the defect directly with the manufacturer of the product. We provide no warranties or guarantees of the product. However, we can assist you in navigating the manufacturer's warranty claim process. Please contact us and we will do our best to help you connect with the appropriate manufacturer support channels.</p>
